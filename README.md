## ARA - FreeRADIUS web interface

This is a my personal backup repository for ARA. The original hosting
is still available at [asn.pl lab ARA page](http://labs.asn.pl/ara/)

ARA is one of many tools I wrote when working for [asn.pl] somewhere around 2005.
It's a bit CRUDe, simple PHP webapp. Nothing fancy but it did the job.

It was basically alternative version for (at least at the time) rather poorly
performing [Dialup Admin](https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/Dialup-admin)

It has been not maintained for a long while, and please don't judge me for code
quality, security issues and other malpractice that I've made at the time. If
anyone is interesting in continuing it's development, I'd be happy to hand it
over.

Despite the warning, I'm aware it's being used and still installed all over the
world till this day.

See `README` for the original README file.
